# Photometric-Identification-of-Compact-Galaxies-Stars-and-Quasars
Deep Learning Algorithms are used to classify the compact galaxies, stars and quasars from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 16 (DR16). The current dataset consists
of 2,40,000 compact objects and 1,50,000 faint objects. The model is trained in a way so
that it reduces human error and also helps in reducing the heavy machinery in classifying the
astronomical images. The current architecture is taken from MargNet, a deep learning classifier
and implemented in the Pytorch framework.
